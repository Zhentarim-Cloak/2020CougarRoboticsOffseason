This document is used to plan the structure of our code
This is to:
    a. Prevent the code from being a spaghetti coded, unorganized mess
    b. Make life easier for future years to read our code

Start Code Planning:

    Robot.class:
       -Wheel.class
            -4 Motors + manipulation methods
       -Arm.class
            -Motor(s) for running arm + Associated Methods
       -Intake.class
            -2 Motors to run intake system
            -Pressure/Light sensor for detecting successful intake
       -Sensors

    OpMode.class
